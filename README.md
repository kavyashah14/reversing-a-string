# Reversing a string
The string reverse technique refers to the change in the order of characters of a given string so that the last character of the string gets changed with the first character and so on. In other words, swapping occurs. While working with strings, you may encounter various scenarios to perform several manipulations. We shall look at ways to achieve string reversal in C and explore some in-built methods to do the same.

# Algorithm
1. Ask user to input a string to be reversed.

2. Store it in an array.

3. Calculate the length of the string by using the strlen function.

4. Apply a for loop from (counter variable= length-1) initially and decrementing the value till (counter variable>=0) , printing the array in reverse.
